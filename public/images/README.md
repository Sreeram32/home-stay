# Homestay Background Image

To add the homestay background image:

1. Save your homestay image as `homestay-background.jpg` in this folder
2. The image should be a night-time view of a traditional-style building with:
   - Red brick walls
   - Dark tiled roof with blue decorative trim
   - Illuminated windows with green borders
   - Warm lighting from within

3. Recommended image specifications:
   - Format: JPG or JPEG
   - Resolution: At least 1200x800 pixels (higher is better)
   - File size: Under 2MB for optimal loading

4. Once you add the image, update the src in `app/page.tsx` from `/next.svg` back to `/images/homestay-background.jpg`

The image will then appear as the background in the hero section of your homepage.
